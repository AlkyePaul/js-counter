JAVASCRIPT BASIC COUNTER

THE PROJECT

This code works as a very simple counter thas sums and subtracts one number at the time starting from 0.

It'is part of my web development course in start 2 impact.

The code is pretty simple as the funcionalities it provides, I don't think it requires any major explanation.  


LENGUAGES USED

HTML  
CSS (SCSS)
Javascript

As part of a JS exercise of the web development course it's written mostly in JS, even when using more HTML would ahve been simplier.
